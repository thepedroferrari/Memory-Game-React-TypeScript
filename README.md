# Memory Game App

Your assignment is to write a simple Memory game. Use the eight pictures attached as front side and the Avalanche logo as the back side of the 16 cards (8 pairs).

The game should be timed and if the player sets a high score (fastest time) she should enter her "username" on a toplist that is shown as a separate tab or view.

The test should be written using Vue.js and should be submitted as a zip archive.
The game should work in Chrome.
Please attach instructions on how to start the game and some description of choices made, things that you would have done differently if there was more time etc.

Please submit your test latest within two weeks. Good luck!
